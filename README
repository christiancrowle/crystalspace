MIRRORED BY CHRISTIAN CROWLE

It appeared to me that crystal space's development was abandoned. The last
commit was in 2015, and many pages on the website are 404s, including the docs.
sourceforge's SVN is also quite spotty, so it's a pain to clone. So here's a git
mirror of trunk. Documentation and the data/ folder for examples will be made available
at http://www.crowle.ca/cspacemirror. For the time being, docs are in this repository.

For any questions or concerns (or if you want access to the other, historic branches,
like the CVS migration or the SOC branches), please contact me at
